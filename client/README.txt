NOTE: This program myPrint.py relies on a library called reprint, and the version of reprint on pip right now is currently bugged. I've fixed it on my machine and 
submitted a pull request, but as of this writing it hasn't been merged, so if you download reprint from pip install and try to run this with python, it probably won't 
work. I'm sorry! Maybe try anyways and hope it's been updated?
